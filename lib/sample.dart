// Argument in function means input
// After every expression, we need to end it with semi-colon. But we don't need semi colon in the end when defining function.
// WE NEED SEMI COLON INSIDE THE CODE BLOCK 
// Variable inside class is called Property and function a method
// What does instance mean i programming?

// Flutter is all about widget
// to create widget we need to create a class
// Constructor in a class is a function which run only once
// Named parameter is optional and we have to name it with its name in the objects like ( thisName: hhfh);
// Text is also a class LOL

// Visible and Invisible Widget
// We are also using deprecated button
//Onpressed takes return value of function, not the function itself, but upon removing parenthesis from
// the function, it will point onpressed where to look for the value.

//Anyoomus Function:
// As the name suggests, setstate, sets and updates the state of the widget what you provide in setstate in function.
// setsate build widget again, 

// I have to learn state management now,

// The function(adress) we're passing around is also known as a 'callback' - because the receiving widget calls it the future.
// we can pass a pointer of a function to onpressed, for that we need to pass it as an argument in constructor( if btton is custom widget)

// How to map list to widget, learn spread operator
// Final vs Const
// What is the purpose of VoidCallback

// how dart manages the object [ like java]

// Principle to learn coding

// try to unnderstand the purpose of the code, not copying the code.
// watch for 10 mins and code the reset
// Try cornell note taking method
// read and research about the code too

// Null Safety Concept
